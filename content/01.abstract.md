## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is a powerful, efficient, and easy-to-use tool for detecting meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns in data.
CCC is particularly useful for transcriptomics, where it can identify genes with correlated expression that may be involved in the same biological processes or diseases.
Compared to other correlation coefficients, CCC is faster and more accurate, as it captures general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identified robust linear relationships as well as nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences that were missed by linear-only methods.
Furthermore, CCC-ranked gene pairs were enriched for interactions in integrated networks, suggesting that CCC can detect functional relationships that linear-only methods fail to capture.
CCC is an ideal tool for quickly and accurately uncovering meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns in genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
